Containers Zero to One Workshop
Welcome to the Containers Zero to One workshop. This workshop aims to provide developers and DevOps engineers with little or no containers experience some hands-on practice from the ground up. We start from containerizing an applicaiton, to deploying a practical containerized application on AWS.

The workshop is structured into two parts: Containers & Docker, and Deploying your container service on AWS App Runner.

Containers & Docker
The first part of our workshop provides an introduction to containers and Docker. This two-part lab begins with Docker basics, covering how to use the Docker cli to manipulate container instances and images. The second part focuses on building a container image using a Dockerfile and creating a production-grade container image.

AWS App Runner
This part of our workshop will launch our example containerized hotel applicaiton from part one as a service on AWS App Runner. We will configure a VPC Connector for App Runner to allow our application to communicate with our RDS database in our VPC, experiment with autoscaling, and observability for our application in App Runner.

Takeaways
By the end of this workshop you will have learned the following:

Container basics and essential Docker commands
How to create a Dockerfile to containerize your application
How to push your container to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
How to deploy a container to App Runner
How to deploy an App Runner service using a custom VPC connector
How to use observability tools such as AWS X-Ray and CloudWatch to see application metrics
